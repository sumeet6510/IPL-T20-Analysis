# IPL-T20-Analysis
Capstone project 1 with team members shafil and kunal. Exploratory Data Analysis of IPL teams.
IPL T20 Cricket Analysis project was done by a group of 3 members â€“ Kunal Agrawal, Shafil Ahmad, and Sumeet Agrawal. In this project, we got 5 different CSV files as input. The CSV files are Matches.csv, deliveries.csv, teams.csv, most_run_team_strikerate.csv, and teamwise_home_and_away.csv.

So, we decided to divide these 5 CSV files among 3 and start exploring the dataset. First, work individually to gain insights by doing some EDA, and then we can merge our data to create a team notebook.
